She grew up admiring her father and his business. Their family had owned The Morrigan Weapon’s Shop for generations. Sybil, not being fond of hunting or killing, still found a way to appreciate the craft and beauty of the shop’s supplies. Occasionally her father would teach her lessons on how to hold a dagger or how to throw a knife. Her favorite has always been the longbow.\nAs the years past, Sybil grew away from the Morrigan. She was often found in local towns aiding with education projects and tutoring. She’d often be commissioned to create curriculums or essay prompts for local schools.\nWith the war going on in the kingdom, the Morrigan grew very busy. She tried to help her father whenever she could while balancing her other jobs and commissions. It wasn’t much longer from then that her father grew sick from being overworked. He passed away and left the Morrigan to Sybil, his only descendant.\nFor a long time, owning the weapon shop kept Sybil’s name out of the war draft. She was able to peacefully aid in the war she couldn’t care less about and make coin while doing so. \nOn the day she was conscripted, Sybil’s heart dropped to the floor. She was able to choose her weapon, her fighting class, but no longer was she allowed to hide behind the business. \nShe selected to be a Ranger since the longbow was always her best and favorite weapon. It also would keep her from close range melee—close range death. \nShe was not looking forward to the bloodshed of war. She wished she could find a way out. Perhaps it was time for that particular wish to come true…\nPersonal Notes…"},"Characters/Backgrounds/Лйнуст-Олави-(Sasha)":{"slug":"Characters/Backgrounds/Лйнуст-Олави-(Sasha)","filePath":"Characters/Backgrounds/Лйнуст Олави (Sasha).md","title":"Лйнуст Олави (Sasha)","links":["Characters/Personal-Notes/(Sasha)-Personal-Note"],"tags":[],"content":"\nPlayer: Sasha (she/her)\nName: Лйнуст Олави\nSpecies:  Goliath\nClass:  Ranger\nPronouns: (He/him)\nDescription:\nPersonal Notes…"},"Characters/Backgrounds/Лйнуст-Олави-(Саша)":{"slug":"Characters/Backgrounds/Лйнуст-Олави-(Саша)","filePath":"Characters/Backgrounds/Лйнуст Олави (Саша).md","title":"Лйнуст Олави (Саша)","links":["Characters/Personal-Notes/(Sasha)-Personal-Note"],"tags":[],"content":"\nPlayer: Sasha (she/her)\nName: Лйнуст Олави\nSpecies:  Goliath\nClass:  Ranger\nPronouns: (He/him)\nDescription:\n7 feet 9 inches tall, warm toned light grey skin, sprinkled with freckles if you look close enough from long days working in sun-reflecting snow. Muscular in a way that makes it clear this bulk came from long hours doing manual labor. Biceps the size of a head. \n -grew up in an extremely secluded mountain encampment that is difficult to reach for all except those who reside in the cold, rocky mountains that make up the terrain. Worked as a lumberjack along with ~70% of the population, but even among the people of the encampment was an outstanding worker due to his hulking size and skill. Could bet on where a tree would fall once cut down and would win. \n-the encampment never learned of the war due to its extreme seclusion, which is why Linust was never drafted in the first rounds. Only once the government started getting desperate and combing the outer reaches of the nation for stragglers and draft-dodgers were they informed of the war and brought in to serve. \n-the encampment never had a formal name, but the residents took to calling it The Boons. \n-due to his size and skill, the rest of the lumberjacks got used to calling Linust whenever a piece of machinery jammed, or a tree wouldn’t fall as it should. Linust would always come and help out, because he knew that no one else could, but secretly, he wondered what it would feel like to be small and have others help you all the time.\nPersonal Notes…"},"Characters/Personal-Notes/(Elizabeth)-Personal-Note":{"slug":"Characters/Personal-Notes/(Elizabeth)-Personal-Note","filePath":"Characters/Personal Notes/(Elizabeth) Personal Note.md","title":"(Elizabeth) Personal Note","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"…"},"Characters/Personal-Notes/(Ethan)-Personal-Note":{"slug":"Characters/Personal-Notes/(Ethan)-Personal-Note","filePath":"Characters/Personal Notes/(Ethan) Personal Note.md","title":"(Ethan) Personal Note","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"…"},"Characters/Personal-Notes/(Graham)-Personal-Note":{"slug":"Characters/Personal-Notes/(Graham)-Personal-Note","filePath":"Characters/Personal Notes/(Graham) Personal Note.md","title":"(Graham) Personal Note","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"…"},"Characters/Personal-Notes/(Sasha)-Personal-Note":{"slug":"Characters/Personal-Notes/(Sasha)-Personal-Note","filePath":"Characters/Personal Notes/(Sasha) Personal Note.md","title":"(Sasha) Personal Note","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"…"},"Characters/Personal-Notes/(Taylor)-Personal-Note":{"slug":"Characters/Personal-Notes/(Taylor)-Personal-Note","filePath":"Characters/Personal Notes/(Taylor) Personal Note.md","title":"(Taylor) Personal Note","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"…"},"Characters/Personal-Notes/Frickcit-Personal-Note":{"slug":"Characters/Personal-Notes/Frickcit-Personal-Note","filePath":"Characters/Personal Notes/Frickcit Personal Note.md","title":"Frickcit Personal Note","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"…"},"Characters/Personal-Notes/Sybil-Personal-Note":{"slug":"Characters/Personal-Notes/Sybil-Personal-Note","filePath":"Characters/Personal Notes/Sybil Personal Note.md","title":"Sybil Personal Note","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"…"},"index":{"slug":"index","filePath":"index.md","title":"index","links":["Characters/Backgrounds/(Elizabeth)","Characters/Backgrounds/(Ethan)","Characters/Backgrounds/Frickcit","Characters/Backgrounds/Silky-Bitterspoon-(Graham)","Characters/Backgrounds/Sybil","Characters/Backgrounds/Лйнуст-Олави-(Саша)","Characters/Backgrounds/Rowan-Sage-(Taylor)"],"tags":[],"content":"\nWelcome to the world of Ghibalia!\nIn a land ravaged by war, you have been taken from your homes.
