She grew up admiring her father and his business. Their family had owned The Morrigan Weapon’s Shop for generations. Sybil, not being fond of hunting or killing, still found a way to appreciate the craft and beauty of the shop’s supplies. Occasionally her father would teach her lessons on how to hold a dagger or how to throw a knife. Her favorite has always been the longbow.\nAs the years past, Sybil grew away from the Morrigan. She was often found in local towns aiding with education projects and tutoring. She’d often be commissioned to create curriculums or essay prompts for local schools.\nWith the war going on in the kingdom, the Morrigan grew very busy. She tried to help her father whenever she could while balancing her other jobs and commissions. It wasn’t much longer from then that her father grew sick from being overworked. He passed away and left the Morrigan to Sybil, his only descendant.\nFor a long time, owning the weapon shop kept Sybil’s name out of the war draft. She was able to peacefully aid in the war she couldn’t care less about and make coin while doing so. \nOn the day she was conscripted, Sybil’s heart dropped to the floor. She was able to choose her weapon, her fighting class, but no longer was she allowed to hide behind the business. \nShe selected to be a Ranger since the longbow was always her best and favorite weapon. It also would keep her from close range melee—close range death. \nShe was not looking forward to the bloodshed of war. She wished she could find a way out. Perhaps it was time for that particular wish to come true…\nPersonal Notes…"},"Characters/Backgrounds/Лйнуст-Олави-(Sasha)":{"slug":"Characters/Backgrounds/Лйнуст-Олави-(Sasha)","filePath":"Characters/Backgrounds/Лйнуст Олави (Sasha).md","title":"Лйнуст Олави (Sasha)","links":["Characters/Personal-Notes/(Sasha)-Personal-Note"],"tags":[],"content":"\nPlayer: Sasha (she/her)\nName: Лйнуст Олави\nSpecies:  Goliath\nClass:  Ranger\nPronouns: (He/him)\nDescription:\nPersonal Notes…"},"Characters/Personal-Notes/(Elizabeth)-Personal-Note":{"slug":"Characters/Personal-Notes/(Elizabeth)-Personal-Note","filePath":"Characters/Personal Notes/(Elizabeth) Personal Note.md","title":"(Elizabeth) Personal Note","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"…"},"Characters/Personal-Notes/(Ethan)-Personal-Note":{"slug":"Characters/Personal-Notes/(Ethan)-Personal-Note","filePath":"Characters/Personal Notes/(Ethan) Personal Note.md","title":"(Ethan) Personal Note","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"…"},"Characters/Personal-Notes/(Graham)-Personal-Note":{"slug":"Characters/Personal-Notes/(Graham)-Personal-Note","filePath":"Characters/Personal Notes/(Graham) Personal Note.md","title":"(Graham) Personal Note","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"…"},"Characters/Personal-Notes/(Sasha)-Personal-Note":{"slug":"Characters/Personal-Notes/(Sasha)-Personal-Note","filePath":"Characters/Personal Notes/(Sasha) Personal Note.md","title":"(Sasha) Personal Note","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"…"},"Characters/Personal-Notes/(Taylor)-Personal-Note":{"slug":"Characters/Personal-Notes/(Taylor)-Personal-Note","filePath":"Characters/Personal Notes/(Taylor) Personal Note.md","title":"(Taylor) Personal Note","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"…"},"Characters/Personal-Notes/Frickcit-Personal-Note":{"slug":"Characters/Personal-Notes/Frickcit-Personal-Note","filePath":"Characters/Personal Notes/Frickcit Personal Note.md","title":"Frickcit Personal Note","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"…"},"Characters/Personal-Notes/Sybil-Personal-Note":{"slug":"Characters/Personal-Notes/Sybil-Personal-Note","filePath":"Characters/Personal Notes/Sybil Personal Note.md","title":"Sybil Personal Note","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"…"},"index":{"slug":"index","filePath":"index.md","title":"index","links":["Characters/Backgrounds/(Elizabeth)","Characters/Backgrounds/(Ethan)","Characters/Backgrounds/Frickcit","Characters/Backgrounds/Silky-Bitterspoon-(Graham)","Characters/Backgrounds/Sybil","Characters/Backgrounds/Лйнуст-Олави-(Sasha)","Characters/Backgrounds/Rowan-Sage-(Taylor)"],"tags":[],"content":"\nWelcome to the world of Ghibalia!\nIn a land ravaged by war, you have been taken from your homes.
